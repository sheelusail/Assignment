Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry, as well as in its many application areas. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ad hocsolution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right. One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas. Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.\n"," \n","We find the number of -combinations of , first by determining the set of combinations and then by simply calculating ."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Bnioeyjz_45n","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":175},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1593969790796,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1147,"user":{"displayName":"Chithra Shetty","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhavInhwPzLry7uDH5_pU4ghGIr0UaCfmkmYFcc=s64","userId":"02996834336959303956"}},"outputId":"3b7fae77-b329-43c7-8353-35df3785d119"},"source":[" \n","from scipy.special import binom          # to calculate the binomial coefficients |A| choose k\n","A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","k = 2\n","# Print all the k-combinations of A\n","choose_k = list(itertools.combinations(A,k))\n","print(\"%i-combinations of %s:  \" %(k,A))\n","for i in choose_k:\n","    print(i)\n","print;print(\"Number of combinations = %i!/(%i!(%i-%i)!) = %i\" %(n,k,n,k,len(choose_k)  ))"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["2-combinations of {1, 2, 3, 4}:  \n","(1, 2)\n","(1, 3)\n","(1, 4)\n","(2, 3)\n","(2, 4)\n","(3, 4)\n","Number of combinations = 4!/(2!(4-2)!) = 6\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hs8P5USnAQDc","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1593969810690,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1236,"user":{"displayName":"Chithra Shetty","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhavInhwPzLry7uDH5_pU4ghGIr0UaCfmkmYFcc=s64","userId":"02996834336959303956"}},"outputId":"ec3b5fa1-c47a-42b6-85a8-2d5673639a12"},"source":[" #Print |A|!/(k!(|A|-k)!) directly\n","print(int(factorial(len(A))/(factorial(k)*factorial(len(A)-k))))"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["6\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0V-Tf3uiAYMa","colab_type":"text"},"source":[" If you want to concatenate characters such as letters of the English alphabet and print them as strings, you can use the join() function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LS9yCMZrAXsq","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":141},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1593969874949,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1471,"user":{"displayName":"Chithra Shetty","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhavInhwPzLry7uDH5_pU4ghGIr0UaCfmkmYFcc=s64","userId":"02996834336959303956"}},"outputId":"a66cb584-b605-427f-8399-585cbc379914"},"source":[" A = {'m','a','t','h'}\n","k = 3\n","# Print all the k-permutations of S\n","n = len(A)\n","permute_k = list(itertools.permutations(A, k))\n","print(\"%i-permutations of %s:\" %(k,A))\n","for i in range(0, len(permute_k)):\n","    print(''.join(permute_k[i]),end=',')\n","print;print (\"Size =  %i!/(%i-%i)!
